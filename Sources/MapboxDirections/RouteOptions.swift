At an intermediate waypoint, if the value of this property is `false`, each returned route may continue straight ahead or turn to either side but may not U-turn.

For example, it would be quite easy for the user to effectively “U-turn” at a waypoint if the user first parks the car and patronizes a restaurant there before embarking on the next leg of the trip. Set this property to `false` if you expect the user to proceed to the next waypoint immediately upon arrival. For example, if the user only needs to drop off a passenger or package at the waypoint before continuing, it would be inconvenient to perform a U-turn at that location.
